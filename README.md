# Celestial Hub
The offical successor of Aqua Games. Embrace the cosmos coming inside you.

# Why are you remaking it? Didn't you remake it 5 times already?
Yes, but DarkModeGames, Incognito Gxmes, Incognition, Emerald Games, and Aqua Games are all very crappy projects. They were made by me a couple years ago. I looked back on the code and realized how crappy it was. There was no organization, I was hard coding everything so that it's compatiable with ONLY my school computers. I wanted to remake it just for fun. Anyways enjoy the updated version.

# When will it be fully released?
The release date is TBD but it will come sometime in the next 3 weeks. No later than the end of October (this month!).
